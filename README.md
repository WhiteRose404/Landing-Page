# Landing-Page

Creating an entire web page from a given design.
The design that we have comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.



## Objectif 
Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect. Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. It doesn’t matter if you use margin: 24px when the design actually has margin: 48px.
